# Company Layoffs
 
## **Project Background**
In recent years, many companies from various industries have faced finanical and economical challenges that have led to significant layoffs. 

It is important to gain a deeper understanding of the economic health of the various industries. This project performs an exploratory data anaylsis, analyzing layoff trends in order to answer business questions that will gain insight on how different industries and companies respond to crises.

### **Insights and recommendations are provided based on the following business questions:**
- What is the maximum number of employees laid off and the highest percentage of layoffs across all companies?
- Which companies laid off their entire workforce, and how many employees were affected?
- What are the total layoffs for each company across all years, and which companies have laid off the most employees?
- What is the time frame during which the layoffs occurred (earliest and latest dates)?
- Which industries have experienced the highest total number of layoffs?
- Which countries have had the most layoffs, and how do the total layoffs compare across different countries?
- How do layoffs compare across different years?
- Which company stages experienced the most layoffs?
- What is the average percentage of layoffs in each industry?
- What are the monthly rolling totals for layoffs?
- What are the total layoffs for each company, and how have layoffs evolved annually for each company?
- Who were the top 5 companies with the most layoffs each year?

## **Data Structure**
The source of data was obtained from [Github](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv). Superstoreâ€™s data consists of 2362 rows from March 2020 to March 2023, containing one table of all layoffs during that period.

The database structure can be seen below:

## **Data Cleaning**
Prior to the exploratory data analysis, data cleaning was performed to remove duplicates, standardize the data, handle missing values, and remove unnecessary columns. 

SQL queries were used to clean the data and are included below. The full SQL data cleaning file can be found [here](./Data%20Cleaning.sql).

### **1. Remove Duplicates**
~~~ WITH duplicate_cte AS
(
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY 
	company, 
    location, 
    industry, 
    total_laid_off, 
    percentage_laid_off, 
    `date`, 
    stage,
	country, 
    funds_raised_millions) as row_num
FROM layoffs_staging
)
DELETE 
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1;
~~~
With this method, I was able to identify and eliminate any duplicate records to ensure that each entry is unique.

### **2. Standardize Data**
~~~
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET company = TRIM(company);
~~~

In this step, trailing white spaces were removed.

~~~
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = 'United States'
WHERE country LIKE 'United States%';
~~~
In this step, Similar entries were altered to have the same name. 

~~~
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = NULL
WHERE `date` = 'NULL';

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;
~~~
In this step, all dates were converted from strings to dates.

### **3. Handle Null and Blank Values**
~~~
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET percentage_laid_off = NULL
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 'NULL';

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = 'NULL';
~~~
In this step, any string nulls were converted to NULL type for future steps.

~~~
UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
	ON t1.company = t2.company
	AND t1.location = t2.location
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;
~~~
In this step, blank values are updated to match their corresponding values.

### **4. Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows**
~~~
DELETE 
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;
~~~
In this step, any rows with null values and the row_num column were deleted.

**Insights**  
In **2020**, the pandemic hit the travel and service industries hard. Uber led with 7,525 layoffs, followed by Booking.com (4,375) and Groupon (2,800). Companies like Swiggy and Airbnb also cut significant numbers.

In **2021**, tech companies began downsizing, with Bytedance (3,600) leading, followed by Katerra (2,434) and Zillow (2,000). The list also included Instacart and WhiteHat Jr.

In **2022**, tech giants like Meta (11,000) and Amazon (10,150) dominated layoffs, reflecting large-scale restructuring. Cisco, Peloton, and Carvana also had significant cuts.

In **2023**, Google topped the list with 12,000 layoffs, followed by Microsoft (10,000) and Ericsson (8,500). Amazon and Salesforce both had 8,000 layoffs, with Dell at 6,650.

## **Recommendations**
- Due to the large amount of layoffs in 2022 and 2003, tech Giants, such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, could focus on **agile workforce management** to help retain talent and reduce finanical burdens.
- As industries such as retail and finance are more sensitive to economic downturns and market shifts, they could focus on **cross-training employees** or **leveraging contract work** to prevent massive layoffs. 
- As startups in Series C and D laid over 19,000 employees, they could focus **funding on buldiing long-term viability** as a caution to overexpansion.
